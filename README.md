# SmartPad
Smartpad or Jpad is a text editor based on java. I tried to clone notepad app on windows and added some extra featues.
Since it was a side project,I've decided that I can no longer provide the level of support and regular updates .

Rather than letting it completely die off, I've open sourced the app and hosted it here to encourage other developers to potentially improve it, use it in their own personal projects, and re-release it to users. I will still occasionally update this app based on my free time.

If you are a developer who's interested in using its current codebase, I encourage you to fork this repository and/or directly contribute to it.
